# MultiWiiApp

This is a project which I started but then abandoned. It was intended to be a base station and config tool for the MultiWii flight controller.
It is a Chrome app which was ultimately supposed to display instruments using flight data as well as either a live video feed or a simulated
Google Earth-style 3D view.
